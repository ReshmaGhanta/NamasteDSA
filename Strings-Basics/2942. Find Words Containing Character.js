/*
You are given a 0-indexed array of strings words and a character x.
Return an array of indices representing the words that contain the character x.
Note that the returned array may be in any order.
*/
// Approach 1: Using default functions
var findWordsContaining = function(words, x) {
    let indices=[];
     for(let i=0;i<words.length;i++){
         if(words[i].includes(x)){
             indices.push(i)
         }
     }
   return indices;
 };


 //Time complexity: O(nâ‹…m)  Where n is the number of words and m is the average length of each word, since includes() scans the string.
// Space complexity: O(k) Where k is the number of indices stored in the result array.

//Approach 2: Using two loops
var findWordsContaining = function(words, x) {
    let indices=[];
     for(let i=0;i<words.length;i++){
          for(let j=0;j<words[i].length;j++){
                if(words[i][j]===x){
                   indices.push(i)
                   break;
                }
          }
     }
   return indices;
 };
// Time Complexity: O(n*m)
//Space Complexity: O(k)
